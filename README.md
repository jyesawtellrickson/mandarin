## Data Sources

### HSK Lists
HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) or the Chinese Proficiency Test is an international standardised exam which tests and rates Chinese language proficiency. It evaluates Chinese language abilities for non-native Chinese speakers in term of using the Chinese language in their daily, academic and professional lives.

Many students learn based off the HSK system which has been specifically designed to help learners pick up the language as quickly as possible. Initially this is the base for the language but eventually this could be changed depending on the goal, e.g. learning Chinese or passing a test.

### Character Decompositions




## To Do
Acquire other learning methods data, e.g. characters from base up
Acquire chinese subtitle data - can we take screencaps as well to link?? :OOO
Train word2vec model on chinese/english to create 'similar' term lists
Map sentences in subtitles to hsk vocab and label accordingly
Decide on 'meaning' of sentence. Thus if a user is interested in a topic we can choose sentences most similar to the topic
Choose an object recognition model
Investigate a model to generate sentences (customized for the user and their vocab / interests)
Map out data tracking for the user history and performance
Create diagrams for UI/UX
Decide on selling points: always new content, image based learning, while you learn so do we
