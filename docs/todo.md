# To Do
Acquire other learning methods data, e.g. characters from base up
Acquire chinese subtitle data - can we take screencaps as well to link?? :OOO
Train word2vec model on chinese/english to create 'similar' term lists
Map sentences in subtitles to hsk vocab and label accordingly
Decide on 'meaning' of sentence. Thus if a user is interested in a topic we can choose sentences most similar to the topic
Choose an object recognition model
Investigate a model to generate sentences (customized for the user and their vocab / interests) [generating isn't the best option, tagging and using is better]
Map out data tracking for the user history and performance
Create diagrams for UI/UX
Decide on selling points: always new content, image based learning, while you learn so do we
Auto generation of sentences?
Medals for certain topics, e.g. animals, throughout the learning process you fill up the meter for this and when a medal has some progress you can start a topic on that.
